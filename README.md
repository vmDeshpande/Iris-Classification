# Flower Classification with Neural Network

This project uses a neural network to classify flowers based on their features. It is trained on the Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classification.git
```

- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the Model
Run the following command to train the neural network:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Evaluating the Model

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set. The accuracy will be displayed in the console.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

## Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

```bash
python predict.py
```
